# <strong>Update: </strong>

<pre>This repositoray used to contain all the projects I had worked on 
as of October 30, 2019. Few days before that date I decided to make a single repository
out of all the porjects while <strong>KEEPING ALL THE COMMITS/TRACE</strong> and I was 
finially able to do it. Now all the projects exists in their own repo with <strong>
OLD COMMITS/TRACE</strong>. 
Note to find all the other projects: all of my projects now has a <strong>Project--</strong>
prefix to them and followed by the project name.
