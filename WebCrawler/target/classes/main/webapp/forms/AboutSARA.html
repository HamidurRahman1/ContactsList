        An admin must have valid username and password to access admin features. A valid admin can provide a reachable url
        and specify how many links from that link can should be crawled and extract the data from those links. Admin can also
        provide how depth should this crawling go from the given link. As well as admin can see how many links have been crawled and
        the user searches.
